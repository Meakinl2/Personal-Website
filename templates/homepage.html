                        <p> I am a third year Computer Science at Coventry University. I have experience in several different coding languages
                            such as Python, C++, and JavaScript; however I do not struggle with learning new syntax and ultimately enjoy discovering
                            the quirks and niche applications that come with with different languages. I enjoy problem solving and the porcess that 
                            comes with designing, implementing, and optomising projects. I have applied my skills through several mediums: game design,
                            web development, application development, ect. While I thrive the best as an idividual I am not adverse to teamwork and can
                            prove myself a consistently useful member provided I am given adequate direction.
